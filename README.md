## Analyzing Dispersion Effects Across Different Language Models

This GitHub repository accompanies our submission to COLING 2025.

All code is executable. You will need to download the files and adjust your repository paths accordingly.
At the beginning of each script (in the CODE folder), you always need to choose either 'FR' or 'EN' for the language.

Any additional results are available upon request.
